A veteran frontend engineer and A/B testing expert, I bring 8 years of experience building high-quality, performant websites and apps using modern tools like React and Shopify. In the past 3 years, I've specialized in CRO and A/B testing, helping e-commerce sites overcome user friction and drive revenue growth through targeted optimization.
